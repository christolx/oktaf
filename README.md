## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Oktaf combines the best elements from established music streaming platforms while introducing innovative solutions to common user experience challenges, creating a more intuitive and enjoyable music discovery and listening experience.

## ✨ UI Enhancements

* **Homepage Interface:** We've adopted a more minimalist design for the homepage, decluttering the interface by removing podcasts and streamlining categories. This creates a cleaner and more focused Browse experience.
* **Albums Library Layout:** The classic grid layout with multiple columns has been reinstated in the albums library, significantly enhancing the ability to browse saved albums. We've also meticulously reworked the sidebar to closely mirror older, familiar versions, providing an intuitive navigation experience.

## 🚀 UX Enhancements

* **Dislike Functionality:** A "**dislike**" feature has been introduced, allowing users to reduce the frequency of specific songs in their recommendations. This helps prevent overplayed tracks from dominating your listening experience.
* **Truly Randomized Shuffle:** Our shuffle function is now genuinely randomized, free from algorithmic influence. This ensures a truly unpredictable and varied playback experience, making music discovery more exciting.
